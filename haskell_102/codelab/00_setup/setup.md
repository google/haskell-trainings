             HASKELL 102

============================================

If you are reading this text, probably you don't have Haskell environment setup
on your system. This should give you enough instructions to install it.

First, note that there are two different ways to get Haskell installed:

1. using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. getting the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)

This course is not taking any side, you are free to install either of these. The
links above point to the install pages for either of the toolchains.

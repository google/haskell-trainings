Welcome to the Haskell 101 codelab!

To run this file, make sure you have the Haskell Platform, and simply:
$ make
$ ./codelab

You can also load this file in ghci:

$ ghci
> :l Codelab
> :l Main
> main
> :r
> main

It will fail hilariously (or ridiculously, depending on your sense of
humor), because you're supposed to write some of the code! You have to
replace and code everything that is named "codelab".

Our goal, here, is to implement some of the built-in functions in the
language, as a way to get familiar with the type system.

Good luck and, most importantly, have fun!

   Nothing to see here, please go directly to section 1!

   This section simply define the "codelab" alias that we'll use
   everywhere in the code and still have it compile and does all the
   necessary boilerplate: imports, compiler options, that kind of stuff.

   As we have not looked at any complex data structures yet, so the

-- Note that Haskell is strict about types even for basic integral types.

   SECTION 2: simple pattern matching

   Not that we can define simple data structures, let's try using them.
-}

data Minutes = Minutes Int

-- Integer division is called "div".  If you want, you can use a function
-- of two arguments as an infix operator, by quoting it using backquotes,
-- like this:
--
--     let v = a `div` b

hours :: Minutes -> Int
hours m = codelab

-- In case you might need some mathematical functions, you can use
--
--     https://hoogle.haskell.org/
--
-- to search for anything supported by the standard library and beyond.
--
-- Distance here means the number of minutes to get from m1 to m2.  For
-- example, for 15 and 25, distance is 10.

timeDistance :: Minutes -> Minutes -> Minutes
timeDistance m1 m2 = codelab

type Point = (Int, Int)

-- Do not forget about Hoogle, should you need a new function.
--
-- Notice, when you declare a new type with the "data" keyword you also
-- declare new constructor(s) that you can use to pattern match on.  But
-- when you are declaring a type alias with the "type" keyword, no
-- constructors are declared.  You will pattern match on the original type
-- you are aliasing - a tuple in this case, for example:
--
--     f :: Point -> Int
--     f (x, y) = abs x + abs y

pointDistance :: Point -> Point -> Double
pointDistance p1 p2 = codelab

   SECTION 3: deconstructing lists

   The default list is ubiquitous in the Prelude; the default String
   type is but a type alias to [Char] after all. Though they have
   limitations, they're always useful.

   As a reminder, a list is either:
     * []     the empty list
     * (x:xs) a cell containing the value x and followed by the list xs
-}


-- null tells you whether a list is empty or not

null :: [a] -> Bool
null fixme = codelab


-- head returns the first element of the list
-- if the list is empty, it panics: this function is partial

head :: [a] -> a
head []    = error "head: empty list"
head fixme = codelab


-- tail returns everything but the first element
-- if the list is empty it panics

tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail = codelab





{- #####################################################################
   SECTION 4: recursion (c.f. SECTION 4)

   There is no loop in Haskell, so to go through a list, we have to use
   recursion. Here are a few more common functions for you to
   reimplement!
-}


-- Do you remember it from the slides?

length :: [a] -> Int
length l = codelab


-- "and" returns True if all the boolean values in the list are True.
-- What do you think it returns for an empty list?

and :: [Bool] -> Bool
and l = codelab


-- "or" returns True if at least one value in the list is True.
-- What do you think it returns for an empty list?

or :: [Bool] -> Bool
or l = codelab


-- "(++)" is the concatenation operator.  To concatenate two linked lists
-- you have to chain the second one at the end of the first one.

(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
l1 ++ l2 = codelab





{- #####################################################################
   SECTION 5: abstractions

   Have you noticed that we keep using the same pattern?  If the list is
   empty we return a specific value.  If it is not, we call a function to
   combine the element with the result of the recursive calls.

   This is Haskell: if there is a pattern, it can (must) be abstracted!
   Fortunately, some useful functions are here for us.

   To understand the difference between foldr and foldl, remember that the
   last letter indicates if the "reduction" function is left associative or
   right associative: foldr goes from right to left, foldl goes from left
   to right.

   foldl :: (a -> x -> a) -> a -> [x] -> a
   foldr :: (x -> a -> a) -> a -> [x] -> a
   foldl (-) 0 [1,2,3,4]   ==   (((0 - 1) - 2) - 3) - 4   ==   -10
   foldr (-) 0 [1,2,3,4]   ==   1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 0)))   ==    -2
-}


-- You probably remember this one?  Nothing extraordinary here.

map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = codelab
map f (a:as) = codelab


-- Same thing here for filter, except that we use it to introduce a new
-- syntax: those | are called "guards"; they let you specify different
-- implementations of your function depending on some Boolean
-- value. "otherwise" is not a keyword but simply a constant whose value is
-- True! Try to evaluate "otherwise" in GHCI.
--
-- Simple example of guards usage:
--   abs :: Int -> Int
--   abs x
--     | x < 0     = -x
--     | otherwise =  x

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter _ [] = codelab
filter f (x:xs)
  | codelab   = codelab
  | otherwise = codelab


-- foldl
-- foldl (-) 0 [1,2,3,4]   ==   (((0 - 1) - 2) - 3) - 4   ==   -10

foldl :: (a -> x -> a) -> a -> [x] -> a
foldl _ a []     = codelab
foldl f a (x:xs) = codelab


-- foldr
-- foldr (-) 0 [1,2,3,4]   ==   1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 0)))   ==    -2

foldr :: (x -> a -> a) -> a -> [x] -> a
foldr _ a []     = codelab
foldr f a (x:xs) = codelab





{- #####################################################################
   BONUS STAGE!

   For fun, you can try reimplementing all the functions in section 4 with
   foldr or foldl! For length, remember that the syntax for a lambda
   function is (\arg1 arg2 -> value).

   You can replace your previous implementation if you want. Otherwise, you
   can add new functions (such as andF, orF), and test them by loading your
   file in GHCI:

   $ ghci
   > :load Codelab
   > and  []
   > andF []

   To go a bit further, you can also try QuickCheck:

   > import Test.QuickCheck
   > quickCheck $ \anyList -> and anyList == andF anyList

   QuickCheck automatically generates tests based on the types expected
   (here, list of boolean values).

   It is also worth noting that there is a special syntax for list
   comprehension in Haskell, which is at a first glance quite similar to
   the syntax of Python's list comprehension

   Python:  [transform(value) for value in container if test(value)]
   Haskell: [transform value  |   value <- container ,  test value ]

   This allows you to succinctly write your map / filters.

{- #####################################################################
   SECTION 6: am I being indecisive? ....hmmmm Maybe?

   Partial functions are bad. Null pointers are a billion dollar
   mistake. Sometimes, what we just want is to have an optional value, a
   value that is either here or not, but with type safety.

   Remember Maybe? If not, here's the definition:

   data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

-- If we were to fix the "head" function, how could we do that?

safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead []    = codelab
safeHead (x:_) = codelab


-- "isNothing" should not need an explanation by now!

isNothing :: Maybe a -> Bool
isNothing = codelab


-- The "fromMaybe" function is your way out of a Maybe value.
-- It takes a default value to use in case our Maybe value is Nothing.

fromMaybe :: a -> Maybe a -> a
fromMaybe _ _ = codelab
-- Consider starting with these patterns:
--
-- fromMaybe def fixme = codelab
-- fromMaybe _   fixme = codelab


-- The "maybe" function is an extended version of "fromMaybe".  Can you
-- guess what it is supposed to do?
-- ...doesn't it kinda look like fold?

maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
maybe _ _ _ = codelab
-- Consider starting with these patterns:
-- maybe b _ fixme = codelab
-- maybe _ f fixme = codelab





{- #####################################################################
   PARTING WORDS

   Have you noticed that we pattern match with Maybe quite like we do
   with lists? You haven't seen Either yet, but spoilers: the pattern
   matching looks quite the same.

   Could we, therefore, define an equivalent of map for Maybe? For Either?
   But how could we write a function with the same name for different
   types? Will we end up needing some kind of *shivers* interface?

   Stay tuned for Haskell 102! :)

   game: Rock Paper Scissors! You don't have to write a lot of code in
   this section; simply take the time to read the code, and fill in the
   few blanks. You'll encounter quite a few functions you haven't seen
   before, and some new weird syntax: if you import this file in GHCI,
   you can easily inspect the type of any function with :t.

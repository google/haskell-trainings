-- As we have not looked at any complex data structures yet, the only thing
-- we have for now is numbers.

add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = codelab

subtract :: Int -> Int -> Int
subtract x y = codelab

double :: Int -> Int
double x = codelab

multiply :: Int -> Int -> Int
multiply x y = codelab

-- Note that Haskell is strict about types even for basic integral types.
-- Int is never automatically converted to Double.  But you can use
-- fromIntegral to convert from any integral type to any number type.
divide :: Int -> Int -> Double
divide x y = codelab

-- Remember that you can use if/then/else:
--
--  if <expr> then <expr> else <expr>
--
-- Integer is just like Int, except that it can store arbitrarily large
-- numbers. Without a type like this, we couldn't compute the factorial of
-- even relatively small numbers.
--
-- Remember that function application binds tighter than operators!
-- E.g.: `3 * f 4` is the same as `3 * (f 4)`, not `(3 * f) 4`.

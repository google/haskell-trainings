# Haskell training: 101 and 102.

This repository contains the source for the slides and the exercises used
in the Haskell trainings at Google. Haskell is not one of the internally
"blessed" languages, but a dedicated team of volunteers is making use of
20% time to try to make Haskell at Google possible! This set of lessons was
created in 2016, to allow newcomers to the language to get involved with
the team.

### Slides

The slides use LaTeX. You'll need `xelatex` installed to build them. Simply
run `make` to create the PDFs. You must also have the [Yanone
Kaffeesatz](https://yanone.de/fonts/kaffeesatz/) fonts installed on your
machine.

### Exercises

The codelabs only require ghc to be installed and in the path. Please read
Codelab.hs and follow the instructions!

### Recordings

Public recordings of the training are available: [Haskell
101](http://youtu.be/cTN1Qar4HSw), [Haskell
102](http://youtu.be/Ug9yJnOYR4U).

### Release

See the [releases](https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings/releases) to
download the generated PDFs and the codelabs.

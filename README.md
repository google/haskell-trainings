# Haskell training: 101 and 102.

This repository contains the source for the slides and the exercises used in the
Haskell trainings at Google. Haskell is not one of the internally "blessed"
languages, but a dedicated team of volunteers is making use of 20% time to try
to make Haskell at Google possible! This set of lessons was created in 2016, to
allow newcomers to the language to get involved with the team.

### Slides

The slides use LaTeX. You'll need `xelatex` installed to build them. Simply run
`make` to create the PDFs. You must also have the [Yanone Kaffeesatz](https://yanone.de/fonts/kaffeesatz/)
fonts installed on your machine. 

### Exercises

The codelabs only require ghc to be installed and in the path. Please read
Codelab.hs and follow the instructions!

### Release

See the [releases](https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings/releases) to 
download the generated PDFs and the codelabs.
